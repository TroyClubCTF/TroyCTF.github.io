	<h3> Introduction </h3>
	<p>
		In the past decade, computer security has become fundamental to our daily lives.
		Many clubs and programs have addressed the need for learning cyber defense, but few have really focused on the opposite: how 			to attack.
		<br/><br/>
		We created ClubCTF because we believe that learning how to attack is necessary to understand how to defend.
		<br/><br/>
		A CTF (short for Capture The Flag) is a special kind of information security competition that combines knowledge from 			programming, web development, cryptography, stenography, operating systems, and other principles of computer science in order 			to hack vulnerable programs. When a program is successfully hacked, it will display a flag (piece of text) to redeem for 			points for your team.
		<br/><br/>
		We hope that you will find learning different and interesting ways to break into programs as exciting as we have.
